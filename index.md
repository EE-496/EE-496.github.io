# About
Our EE 496 Capstone project is to create a game in Unity, a cross-platform game development engine used to build high quality 3D and 2D games.  We chose this project in order to gain experience designing a product that incorporates various aspects of game development including project management and machine learning.  Our objective is to learn how to design, produce, and release a product while also learning how to use popular tools, such as the Unity game engine, and programming languages, such as C#.  

[You can view the game here](https://github.com/EE-496/honu)

### System Walkthough
The main menu allows you to do one of the following: start game, duel mode, turn background music on/off, and turn sound effects on/off.  The main menu also displays your high score!  

When you start the game, you are presented with one of the following mini games:
* Make the poke bowl
* Reel in the fish
* Hurricane proof the windows
* Help the turtle swim
* Remember the sequence
* Chop the log
* Swat the flies

As you play, you can view how much time you have left for a mini game by checking the progress bar.  

# Installation Instructions
* [download a copy of the game](https://github.com/EE-496/honu) by cloning the repository using ```git clone``` and opening it in the Unity Game Engine.
